    <strong>Example:</strong>

    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Growing Menace of Plastic Pollution</p>
    <p><strong>Respected Sir/Madam,</strong></p>
    <p>I am Sanskar Shep, a concerned student and environmental enthusiast, writing to you to express my concern about the increasing plastic pollution in our city. Every street corner is littered with plastic bags and bottles, which not only spoil the environment but also endanger the lives of animals and marine life.</p>
    <p>This situation has worsened over the last few years due to lack of strict regulations and awareness. Most people continue using plastic despite the ban due to the absence of alternatives and weak enforcement. Local authorities must impose heavy penalties on violators and initiate cleanup drives regularly.</p>
    <p>I request you to highlight this issue in your esteemed newspaper so that awareness spreads among the masses and actions are taken by the authorities. A plastic-free environment is not just a dreamâ€”it is a necessity. Your support can make a significant difference.</p>
    <p><strong>Sincerely,<br>Sanskar Shep</strong></p>
