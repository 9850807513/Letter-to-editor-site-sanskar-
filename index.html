  <h1>How to Tell Wild Animals – Carolyn Wells</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stanza 1</h2>
    <div class="poem">
      If ever you should go by chance<br>
      To jungles in the east;<br>
      And if there should to you advance<br>
      A large and tawny beast,<br>
      If he roars at you as you’re dying,<br>
      You’ll know it is the Asian Lion…
    </div>
    <div class="word-meaning">
      <strong>Tawny:</strong> Yellowish-brown<br>
      <strong>Advance:</strong> Move forward<br>
      <strong>Roars:</strong> Loud deep sound made by lions
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The poet says that if you go to a jungle in the East and see a large yellow-brown animal approaching and roaring loudly, you are meeting an Asian Lion.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stanza 2</h2>
    <div class="poem">
      Or if some time when roaming round,<br>
      A noble wild beast greets you,<br>
      With black stripes on a yellow ground,<br>
      Just notice if he eats you.<br>
      This simple rule may help you learn<br>
      The Bengal Tiger to discern.
    </div>
    <div class="word-meaning">
      <strong>Roaming:</strong> Wandering<br>
      <strong>Noble:</strong> Majestic<br>
      <strong>Discern:</strong> Recognize
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      If you see a striped yellow animal and it eats you, it’s a Bengal Tiger. The poet humorously suggests you can only tell once it’s too late.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stanza 3</h2>
    <div class="poem">
      If strolling forth, a beast you view,<br>
      Whose hide with spots is peppered,<br>
      As soon as he has leapt on you,<br>
      You’ll know it is the Leopard.<br>
      ’Twill do no good to roar with pain,<br>
      He’ll only lep and lep again.
    </div>
    <div class="word-meaning">
      <strong>Peppered:</strong> Covered with<br>
      <strong>Strolling:</strong> Walking slowly<br>
      <strong>Lep:</strong> Leap (jump)
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      A spotted animal that jumps on you repeatedly is a Leopard. Screaming won't help, it will continue attacking.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stanza 4</h2>
    <div class="poem">
      If when you’re walking round your yard<br>
      You meet a creature there,<br>
      Who hugs you very, very hard,<br>
      Be sure it is a Bear.<br>
      If you have any doubts, I guess<br>
      He’ll give you just one more caress.
    </div>
    <div class="word-meaning">
      <strong>Caress:</strong> Gentle touch
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      If a creature hugs you tightly, it might be a bear. If you're unsure, it may hug again — deadly but described humorously.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stanza 5</h2>
    <div class="poem">
      Though to distinguish beasts of prey<br>
      A novice might nonplus,<br>
      The Crocodile you always may<br>
      Tell from the Hyena thus:<br>
      Hyenas come with merry smiles;<br>
      But if they weep they’re Crocodiles.
    </div>
    <div class="word-meaning">
      <strong>Nonplus:</strong> Confuse<br>
      <strong>Beasts of prey:</strong> Hunting animals<br>
      <strong>Novice:</strong> Beginner
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Hyenas look like they’re laughing, crocodiles look like they’re crying. That’s the humorous way to tell them apart.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stanza 6</h2>
    <div class="poem">
      The true Chameleon is small,<br>
      A lizard sort of thing;<br>
      He hasn’t any ears at all,<br>
      And not a single wing.<br>
      If there is nothing on the tree,<br>
      ’Tis the chameleon you see.
    </div>
    <div class="word-meaning">
      <strong>Chameleon:</strong> A lizard that changes colour<br>
      <strong>'Tis:</strong> It is
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Chameleons are hard to see because they blend with their surroundings. If you see nothing, it's probably a chameleon!
    </div>
  </div>
