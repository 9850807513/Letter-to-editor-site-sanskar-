      <p>Dear Sir/Madam,<br><br>
      Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the concerned authorities towards the increasing problem of noise pollution in our area.

Despite repeated complaints, no strict actions have been taken so far. I request the concerned departments to take immediate steps to control this menace. Awareness campaigns, restrictions on unnecessary honking, and enforcement of noise rules can help greatly.<br><br>
