        Subject: Need to control noise pollution in urban areas<br><br>
        Sir,<br><br>
        I am writing to draw your attention to the growing problem of noise pollution in our city. The constant honking, loudspeakers during festivals, and construction activities are creating an unbearable environment. Children and elderly people are unable to rest or study properly. Despite rules being present, implementation is very weak. I urge the authorities through your respected newspaper to take strict action and create awareness among citizens to maintain peace and silence. A peaceful city is everyone’s right and responsibility.<br><br>
