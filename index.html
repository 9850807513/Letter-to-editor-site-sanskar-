  <h2>Stanza-Wise Explanation</h2>
  <h3>Stanza 1</h3>
  <p>
    The poet says if you go to the jungles of Asia and a large, tawny (yellowish-brown) beast roars loudly at you and you are dying because of fear, then you have met an Asian lion.
  </p>
  <h3>Stanza 2</h3>
  <p>
    If you are roaming in the forest and suddenly you see a wild animal with black stripes on a yellow body, and if it jumps on you and eats you, then it is the Bengal Tiger.
  </p>
  <h3>Stanza 3</h3>
  <p>
    If you spot a beast that is spotted and he pounces on you continuously, biting you hard, then it's a leopard. Crying will not help you because he will continue to bite.
  </p>
  <h3>Stanza 4</h3>
  <p>
    If you see a creature hugging you tightly and you feel like you are being squeezed to death, then it is probably a bear. The poet says you will easily know it is a bear by the way it hugs.
  </p>
  <h3>Stanza 5</h3>
  <p>
    The poet describes a crocodile as a creature that weeps while eating its prey. It is used humorously, as “crocodile tears” are fake tears.
  </p>
  <h3>Stanza 6</h3>
  <p>
    The chameleon is a small animal that changes its colour. The poet says if you see a tree with nothing on it, and yet you know there's something, then it's probably a chameleon blending in.
