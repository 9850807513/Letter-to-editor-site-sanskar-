      <h2>What are Letters?</h2>
      <p>Letters are written messages used to communicate information, feelings, or ideas. They can be handwritten or typed and are usually sent by post, email, or delivered in person. Letter writing is an essential skill, especially for official and formal communication.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="types">
      <h2>Types of Letters</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Formal Letters:</strong> Used for official communication like complaints, applications, and enquiries. These are structured and polite.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Informal Letters:</strong> Written to friends or family. These are casual and friendly.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Semi-formal Letters:</strong> Written to someone known but in a formal setup, like a teacher or neighbor.</p>
      <p><strong>Why Informal Letters are less used:</strong> With the rise of digital apps and messaging platforms, informal letters are no longer commonly written on paper. Most people use texts or social media for casual chats.</p>

    <div class="section" id="subject">
      <h2>How to Write a Good Subject</h2>
      <p>The subject line gives a quick idea of the purpose of your letter. Keep it short, clear, and related to the content. Use proper keywords.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Subject: Request for Sick Leave</li>
        <li>✅ Subject: Complaint Regarding Noise Pollution</li>
        <li>✅ Subject: Enquiry About Summer Classes</li>
      </ul>

          <p>I request you to take urgent action by arranging for regular garbage pickup, proper drainage, and repairs. Your support will help in maintaining a healthy environment.</p>
