  <h2>Full Poem</h2>

  <div class="stanza">
    If ever you should go by chance<br>
    To jungles in the East;<br>
    And if there should to you advance<br>
    A large and tawny beast,<br>
    If he roars at you as you’re dying,<br>
    You’ll know it is the Asian Lion…
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    Or if sometime when roaming round,<br>
    A noble wild beast greets you,<br>
    With black stripes on a yellow ground,<br>
    Just notice if he eats you.<br>
    This simple rule may help you learn<br>
    The Bengal Tiger to discern.
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    If strolling forth, a beast you view,<br>
    Whose hide with spots is peppered,<br>
    As soon as he has leapt on you,<br>
    You’ll know it is the Leopard.<br>
    ’Twill do no good to roar with pain,<br>
    He’ll only lep and lep again.
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    If when you’re walking round your yard<br>
    You meet a creature there,<br>
    Who hugs you very, very hard,<br>
    Be sure it is a Bear.<br>
    If you have any doubts, I guess<br>
    He’ll give you just one more caress.
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    Though to distinguish beasts of prey<br>
    A novice might nonplus,<br>
    The Crocodile you always may<br>
    Tell from the Hyena thus:<br>
    Hyenas come with merry smiles;<br>
    But if they weep they’re Crocodiles.
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    The true Chameleon is small,<br>
    A lizard sort of thing;<br>
    He hasn’t any ears at all,<br>
    And not a single wing.<br>
    If there is nothing on the tree,<br>
    ’Tis the chameleon you see.
  </div>

  <h2>Stanza-Wise Explanation</h2>

  <h3>Stanza 1</h3>
  <p>If you go to the jungle and see a large, yellow-brown animal roaring loudly — and it scares you to death — that’s the Asian Lion.</p>

  <h3>Stanza 2</h3>
  <p>If you see an animal with black stripes on a yellow body that jumps and eats you — that's the Bengal Tiger.</p>

  <h3>Stanza 3</h3>
  <p>A spotted animal that leaps at you again and again and bites you is a Leopard.</p>

  <h3>Stanza 4</h3>
  <p>An animal that hugs you tightly and doesn't let go — it's a Bear showing affection (or attack).</p>

  <h3>Stanza 5</h3>
  <p>A Hyena smiles while the Crocodile cries. If it smiles, it’s a Hyena. If it cries, it’s a Crocodile.</p>

  <h3>Stanza 6</h3>
  <p>If you see nothing but feel something is there, it could be a Chameleon, which blends with its surroundings.</p>
