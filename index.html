Subject: Need for Stricter Waste Management in Urban Areas

Sir/Madam,

Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I want to highlight the serious issue of poor waste management in urban areas. The overflowing garbage and lack of proper disposal systems are causing health hazards.

This issue affects not just the environment but also the daily lives of citizens. It is high time authorities take strict measures, such as better garbage collection, awareness campaigns, and fines for littering.

I hope you will publish this letter to draw attention to this concern.

Yours sincerely,
Sanskar Patil
