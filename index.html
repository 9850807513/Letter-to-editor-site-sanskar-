    <h2>Letter to the Editor – Example</h2>
    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Increasing Noise Pollution in Urban Areas</p>
      <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
      <p>I am writing to bring attention to the growing issue of noise pollution in our city. The honking of vehicles, construction noise, and loudspeakers have made daily life extremely stressful for the residents.</p>
      <p>This persistent noise not only affects mental peace but also poses serious health risks like hearing loss and hypertension. Students and elderly people are the worst affected as they need a peaceful environment.</p>
      <p>Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I urge the authorities to implement stricter rules and raise awareness to control noise pollution. I hope this concern reaches the responsible departments soon.</p>
